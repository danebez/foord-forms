                    <li>A South African Financial Institution/Partner Jurisdiction Financial Institution typically includes any financial institution registered with the Financial Services Board, including, but not limited to, an investment
				        company, a collective investment scheme, a linked investment service provider (LISP), a retirement fund, an insurance company.</li>
				    <li>A Foreign Financial Institution (FFI) is a foreign entity that accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business; holds financial assets for the account of others as a substantial portion of its
				        business; or is engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting or trading in securities, partnership interests, commodities, or any interest (including a futures or forward contract or option) in such
				        securities, partnership interests, or commodities. A Participating FFI is one that has entered into an agreement with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the United States of America.</li>
				    <li>A Non-Participating FFI is a foreign entity (as described above) that has not entered into an agreement with the IRS and is subject to withholding tax under FATCA.</li>
				    <li>An entity that is resident in the United States of America, or in a United States Territory, for tax purposes.</li>
				    <li>An FFI (as described above) that registers with the IRS to declare its tax status.</li>
				    <li>The term "Exempt beneficial owner" means:<br>
				        <ol>
				            <li>The South African Government, provincial, national or local government authorities and the Accounting Standards Board;</li>
					        <li>A foreign government and any subdivisions of a foreign government;</li>
					        <li>The South African Reserve Bank (SARB);</li>
					        <li>A foreign bank of central issue;</li>
					        <li>Any South African office of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the World Bank, the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, The International Finance Corporation, the
					            International Finance Corporation Order, 1955 (SI 1955 No. 1954), the International Development Association, the African Development Bank, the OECD Support Fund, the Inter-American
					            Development Bank;</li>
						    <li>Governments of United States Territories;</li>
						    <li>Occupational and umbrella pension and provident funds, pension and provident preservation funds and retirement annuity funds;</li>
						    <li>Entities wholly owned by any of the entities in 6.1 to 6.7 above.</li>
						</ol>
				    </li>
				    <li>An Active Non-Financial Entity is any Non-Financial Entity (NFE) that meets one of the following criteria:<br>
				        <ol>
					        <li>Less than 50% of the NFE’s gross income for the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period is passive income (such as dividends, interest, royalties, annuities and rent) and
					            less than 50% of the assets held by the NFE during the preceding calendar year or other appropriate reporting period are assets that produce or are held for the production of passive income;</li>
					        <li>The stock of the NFE is regularly traded on an established securities market or the NFE is a Related Entity of an entity, the stock of which is traded on an established securities market;</li>
					        <li>The NFE is a government, a political subdivision of such government, or a public body performing a function of such government or a political subdivision thereof, or an entity wholly owned by
					            one or more of the foregoing;</li>
					        <li>Substantially all of the activities of the NFE consist of holding (in whole or part) the outstanding stock of, or providing financing and services to, one or more subsidiaries that engage in trades or
					            businesses other than the business of a Financial Institution. However, the entity will not qualify as an active NFE if it functions (or holds itself out to be) an investment fund or any investment
					            vehicle whose purpose is to acquire or fund companies and then hold interests in those companies as capital assets for investment purposes. In these circumstances the entity will be a Passive
	            				NFE;</li>
					        <li>The NFE is not yet operating a business and has no prior operating history, but is investing capital into assets with the intent to operate a business other than that of a Financial Institution;
					            provided that the NFE shall not qualify for this exception after the date that is 24 months after the date of the initial organisation of the NFE;</li>
					        <li>The NFE was not a Financial Institution in the past 5 years, and is in the process of liquidating its assets, or is reorganising with the intent to continue or recommence operations in a business
					            other than that of a Financial Institution;</li>
					        <li>The NFE primarily engages in financing and hedging transactions with or for Related Entities, that are not Financial Institutions, and does not provide financing or hedging services to any entity
					            that is not a Related Entity, provided that the group of any such Related Entities is primarily engaged in a business other than that of a Financial Institution;</li>
					        <li>The NFE is organised in a US Territory and all the owners of the payee are bona fide residents of that US Territory; or</li>
					        <li>The NFE meets ALL of the following criteria:<br>
					            <ol>
						            <li>It is established and operated in its jurisdiction of residence exclusively for religious, charitable, artistic, cultural, athletic, or educational purposes; or it is established and operated in
						                its jurisdiction or residence and it is a professional organisation, business league, chamber of commerce, labour organisation, agricultural or horticultural organisation, civic league or
						                an organisation operated exclusively for the promotion of social welfare;</li>
						            <li>It is exempt from income tax in its country of residence;</li>
						            <li>It is has no shareholders or members who have a proprietary or beneficial interest in its income or assets;</li>
						            <li>The applicable laws of the entity’s country of residence or the entity’s formation documents do not permit any income or assets of the entity to be distributed to, or applied for the
						                benefit of, a private person or non-charitable entity other than pursuant to the conduct of the entity’s charitable activities, or as payment of a reasonable compensation for services
						                rendered, or as payment representing the fair market value of property which the entity has purchased; and</li>
						            <li>The applicable laws of the entity’s country of residence or the entity’s formation documents require that, upon the entity’s liquidation or dissolution, all of its assets be distributed to a
						                governmental entity or other non-profit organisation, or escheat to the government of the entity’s country of residence or any political subdivision thereof.</li>
						            <li>A Passive NFE is any NFE that is not an Active NFE.</li>
