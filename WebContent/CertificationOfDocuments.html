			<p>
	            Copies should be certified as correct copies of the original by a respected professional person (i.e. a notary public, a lawyer, accountant or banker), using substantially the following form of certification:
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            "I <b>[name of person]</b>, hereby certify that the copy of the identification documentation attached hereto is a true and correct copy of the original document produced to me."
	        </p>
	        <p>
	            The certifier should sign and date the copy document (printing his or her name clearly underneath) and clearly indicate the position of capacity on it together with a contact
	            phone number.
