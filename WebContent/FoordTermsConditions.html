		<h1>FOORD TERMS &amp; CONDITIONS</h1>
		<div id="modal">
		    <ol>
		        <li>This application, together with the Main Deed and the relevant Supplemental Deeds, will govern the legal relationship between the investor and Foord Unit Trusts (RF) (Pty) Ltd ("Foord"). It is at Foord's sole discretion to accept or reject the investor's application form.</li>
		        <li>For the purposes of this agreement, unless the context indicates otherwise, the singular shall include the plural and vice versa, reference top a natural person shall include bodies corporate and vice versa, reference to any gender shall include the other gender and clause headings have been inserted for convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of the agreement.</li>
		        <li>Collective Investment Schemes in Securities (unit trusts) are generally medium to long term investments. The value of participatory interests (units) may go down as well as up and past performance is not necessarily a guide to the future. Unit trusts can engage in borrowing. Foord does not engage in scrip lending. Commission and incentives may be paid and if so, are not borne by the investor. A schedule of fees and charges and maximum commissions is available on request from Foord. All of the Foord unit trusts may be capped at any time in order for them to be managed in accordance with their mandates. The portfolio may include underlying foreign investments. Fluctuations or movements in exchange rates may cause the value of underlying international investments to go up or down. The underlying foreign investments may be adversely affected by political instability as well as exchange controls, changes in taxation, foreign investment policies, restrictions on repatriation of investments and other restrictions and controls which may be imposed by the relevant authorities in the relevant countries. A feeder fund is a portfolio that, apart from assets in liquid form, consists solely of units in a single portfolio of a collective investment scheme, which levies its own charges and which could result in a higher fee structure for these portfolios. A fund of funds invests only in other Collective Investment Schemes, which may levy their own charges, which could result in a higher fee structure for these portfolios.</li>
		        <li>The investor acknowledges the inherent risk associated with the selected investments and that there are no guarantees. The investor furthermore agrees that Foord will not be liable for the consequences of market influences and consequent changes in unit prices.</li>
		        <li>Unit trust prices are calculated on a net asset value basis. This is the total value of all assets in the portfolio including any income accruals less any permissible deductions from the portfolio. Permissible deductions from the total portfolio include bank charges, trustee / custodian fees, audit fees, manager's annual fees, securities transfer tax and brokerage. Forward pricing is used.</li>
		        <li>Units are traded at ruling prices and will be repurchased by Foord in accordance with the requirements of the Collective Investment Schemes Control Act and on terms and conditions set forth in the relevant Deed. The portfolios are valued daily at 15h00. The business cut-off time for receiving an instruction is 14h00. Should an instruction be received after 14h00, it will only be processed on the following business day, at the price determined on that day (excluding weekends and public holidays).</li>
                <li>Investments will only be processed on receipt of monies, proof of deposit and all required documentation. No interest shall accrue to monies awaiting allocation.</li>
                <li>Any units purchased as a result of a cheque deposit or debit order cannot be repurchased, switched or transferred within 14 days of each investment date.</li>
                <li>Statements and reports are sent to all investors on a quarterly basis. Advice notes are sent on a transaction basis (excluding debit orders).</li>
                <li>All redemptions must be requested on the prescribed form and will be executed following receipt and acceptance of such written instruction and subject to Foord's requirements having been met. Please note that in the case of redemptions, settlement may take up to 48 hours.</li>
                <li>Investors wishing to redeem units amounting to more than 5% of the total market value of the relevant unit trust fund portfolio must provide Foord with at least 7 business days' written notice of such redemption. If this notice is not received by Foord, Foord may treat such withdrawal as only having taken place on the 7th business day after such instruction is received. However, where the amount to be redeemed exceeds 10% of the total market value of the portfolio, the parties shall determine the actual date of withdrawal through mutual agreement between them.</li>
                <li>Security cessions in respect of investments will only be recorded based on a number of units, and not in respect of any Rand amount.</li>
                <li>Foord will not be responsible for any loss, consequential or otherwise, arising from changes in tax or legislation that may have an impact on the performance of the investments. Distributions may be subject to mandatory withholding taxes. Please consult your tax advisor regarding the potential tax consequences of this investment, which may include income and capital gains taxes.</li>
                <li>Foord reserves the right to terminate this contract by giving 5 days notice to the investor. Units shall be repurchased on the 5th day after notification of termination at the ruling price on that day. Any proceeds from the termination shall be paid into the investor's bank account given in the application form.</li>
                <li>Investors must provide current contact details to Foord Unit Trusts. If an investor becomes uncontactable or if a distribution or redemption payment is rejected by the recipient bank, their participatory interests will be considered to be unclaimed units. Foord will make reasonable attempts to contact holders of unclaimed units, which may include making use of an external tracing company. Related costs may be recovered from these investors. Unclaimed units will remain invested in the portfolio, until the units are claimed or transferred to another portfolio with the Registrar's consent.</li>
                <li>No indulgence granted by Foord shall effect or prejudice the rights of Foord, nor shall it be regarded as a waiver of Foord's rights.</li>
                <li>Foord holds both professional indemnity and fidelity insurance cover.</li>
                <li>Foord is a registered VAT vendor. VAT registration number: 4560201594.<br><br>
                    <b>Only applicable if appointing a Financial Advisor:</b></li>
                <li>Foord will only accept applications submitted on behalf of investors from FSP's who have been granted a license by the Financial Services Board. Foord will verify the existence of such FSP license but it is the responsibility of the FSP to ensure he /she acts within the license conditions.</li>
                <li>Foord cannot be held responsible or liable for loss or damage suffered by the investor as a result of the FSP acting outside his / her license parameters or because of delays in the processing or rejection of this application form, caused by the fact that the investor's Financial Advisor is not authorised as a Financial Services Provider or is not approved by Foord.</li>
                <li>The Financial Advisor is responsible for ensuring that the investor receives and understands all appropriate advice, product and fee information including changes in the working practices and procedures of Foord.</li>
